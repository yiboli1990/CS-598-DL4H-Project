# CS-598 Deep Learning for Healthcare Project

This repository contains all the necessary code and documentation for the CS-598 Deep Learning for Healthcare project focused on predicting intraoperative hypotension using physiological waveforms. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze arterial blood pressure (ABP), electroencephalogram (EEG), and electrocardiogram (ECG) data.

## Project Overview

### Background
Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) is a significant perioperative issue associated with increased risks of acute kidney injury, myocardial injury, and other complications. This project aims to develop a predictive model that can forecast IOH events effectively, thereby enhancing patient outcomes through timely interventions.

### Objectives
- To predict the occurrence of intraoperative hypotension using machine learning models.
- To evaluate the effectiveness of different physiological waveforms in predicting IOH.

## Repository Structure

- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.
- `ioh_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all the analyses and model training code.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python dependencies necessary to run the code.
- `data/`: Directory containing datasets used (if publicly shareable).
